# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses Machine Learning to analyze student data and predict their total academic performance based on various factors such as math score, reading score, writing score, gender, parental education, and other attributes.

The main goal is to compare multiple machine learning models and identify which model gives the best prediction accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains student academic details including:

* Gender
* Race / Ethnicity
* Parental level of education
* Lunch type
* Test preparation course
* Math score
* Reading score
* Writing score

A new feature was created:

**Total Marks = Math + Reading + Writing**
